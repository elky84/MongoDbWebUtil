# MongoDbWebUtil

## introduce

MongoDb with ASP.NET Web Utilities.

This is a package that collects common codes that can be useful when using ASP.NET 3 or later version that uses MongoDB as the main DB.

Codes that can be useful even when using MongoDB as an auxiliary are included, so you can use them when linking MongoDB or refer to their implementation.
